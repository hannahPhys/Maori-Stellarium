## MƒÅori Stellarium Application

# Overview

The MƒÅori Stellarium application is an interactive, web-based star map that visualizes the night sky as seen from specific locations, with a focus on MƒÅori celestial navigation and star lore. The application allows users to explore constellations, individual stars, and the southern celestial hemisphere with culturally significant MƒÅori names and narratives.

# Features

	‚Ä¢	Accurate Star Mapping:
	‚Ä¢	Uses Hipparcos star catalog data for precise rendering of star positions.
	‚Ä¢	Displays stars based on the observer‚Äôs location (e.g., Queenstown, New Zealand).
	‚Ä¢	Includes magnitude-based brightness scaling for realistic visuals.
	‚Ä¢	Interactive Exploration:
	‚Ä¢	Hover over stars to reveal their names (both MƒÅori and Western).
	‚Ä¢	Rotate, zoom, and pan the star map using mouse controls.
	‚Ä¢	Cultural Integration:
	‚Ä¢	Highlights key MƒÅori stars and constellations such as Puanga (Rigel), Matariki (Pleiades), and Tautoru (Orion‚Äôs Belt).
	‚Ä¢	Includes visual markers for culturally significant points like the South Celestial Pole.
	‚Ä¢	Educational Tool:
	‚Ä¢	Designed for learning about MƒÅori astronomy and its connection to navigation, agriculture, and storytelling.

# Key Components

	1.	Star Data:
	‚Ä¢	Utilizes a JSON file with stars mapped to their Hipparcos catalog numbers, along with common and MƒÅori names.
	2.	Three.js for Rendering:
	‚Ä¢	Displays the star field in a 3D environment.
	‚Ä¢	Handles interactive controls and animations.
	3.	Hover Tooltips:
	‚Ä¢	Tooltip displays dynamically on mouse hover, showing the star‚Äôs name and any additional information.
	4.	South Celestial Pole Marker:
	‚Ä¢	A red sphere marks the approximate position of Sigma Octantis near the South Celestial Pole.

# Planned Enhancements

	‚Ä¢	Add MƒÅori constellation overlays with cultural stories.
	‚Ä¢	Implement a time slider to visualize the night sky across seasons.
	‚Ä¢	Provide multilingual support for MƒÅori and English.
	‚Ä¢	Integrate local sidereal time calculations for more precise star positioning.
